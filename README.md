# Move Items in SWADE

**A Foundry VTT module for Savage Worlds Adventure Edition that allows moving Items between Actors instead of just copying them.**

This module allows for moving Items between SWADE Actors by dragging and dropping. To move a quantity of Items, simply hold down the Alt/Option key before dragging an item from one Actor to another. The Item quantities on each Actor will be adjusted accordingly.
