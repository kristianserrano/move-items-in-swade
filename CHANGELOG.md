# Move Items in SWADE

## v1.1.0

- Reverses the Alt/Option key logic so that the module respects default Foundry VTT behavior. Pressing Alt while dragging now activates the module's functionality.
- Item quantities from characters' inventories are now increased/decreased when an item with more than 1 for quantity is dragged between characters while holding Alt/Option. For example, if a character has rations with a quantity of 10 and the item is dragged to another sheet, it adds 1 to the other character and deducts one from the source character. If the item only has a quantity of 1, it deletes the item after moving it.

## v1.0.0

- Initial release
